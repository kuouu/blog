Hello! I'm Eric Kuo, a Master's student in Software Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University, with a Bachelor's degree from National Cheng Kung University. 

I specialize in software engineering and system design, leveraging C/C++ and Go to develop robust platforms. Notably, I've implemented automated workflows that significantly optimized in-house engineering processes. Currently, I'm focused on enhancing ML/DL algorithms, specifically through kernel functions and compiler improvements, to enable efficient training and deployment of large-scale foundation models.
